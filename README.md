- Hey, I am currently a Y11 student (2024) and was really interested to start a project that i find interesting.
- Which is a personal budget tracker, i decide to called it the PBTproject, not the best one but will work for now.
- I wanted to use Github just to track my work, and to show that this work is mine, like in terms of, i did myself, and not stealed someone else's project and saying it's mine.
- Yea, that should be all :)
- (believe it will help with my CV for uni later on too, haha, im really ahead of life;) )
